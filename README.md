This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an incorrect useEffect dependency array. The bug.js file shows the buggy code, while bugSolution.js provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from useEffect's dependency array being improperly defined, leading to unnecessary re-renders and an infinite loop. The solution demonstrates proper use of the dependency array to prevent this issue.
